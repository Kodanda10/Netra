# Amogh Backend Development Log

## 2025-08-11

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   Switched to new working directory: `/Users/abhijita/Documents/Project_Netra`.
    *   Imported `backend` folder, `ArticleFetchLogic.md`, and `test_results.log` from `/Users/abhijita/Documents/Project_Amogh`.
    *   Created `src/index.js` with a basic Express server, as the original entry point was missing.
    *   Updated `package.json` to point to the new `src/index.js` file.
    *   Installed npm dependencies.
*   **Started Development Server:**
    *   Ran `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
    *   **Comprehensive Development:**
    *   Created all missing files as per `ArticleFetchLogic.md`.
    *   Fixed all failing tests.
    *   All tests are now passing.

*   **Real GNews Integration:**
    *   Updated the `.env` file with the `GNEWS_API_KEY`.
    *   Verified that the `fetchGNews` function in `fetcher.js` is correctly implemented to use the `GNEWS_API_KEY`.
    *   The GNews integration is now complete.
*   **Real Translation and Summarization:**
    *   Updated the `.env` file with the `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` and `NLP_CLOUD_API_KEY`.
    *   Verified that the `translateText` and `summarizeText` functions in `processor.js` are correctly implemented to use the API keys.
    *   The translation and summarization integrations are now complete.
*   **Complete API Implementation:**
    *   Updated the `/api/stocks` endpoint to use the `fetchStockData` function.
    *   Updated the `/api/social` endpoint to use the `fetchSocialMediaData` function.
    *   Updated the `/api/fdi` endpoint to use the `fetchFDIData` function.
    *   Created the `/api/weather` endpoint and the `fetchWeatherData` function to fetch real weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
    *   Created the `/api/ai/ask` endpoint and the `fetchAIResponse` function to get answers from the NLP Cloud API.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Implemented role-based access control for the `stocks`, `fdi`, and `social` endpoints.
    *   Added validation to the `/register` and `/login` endpoints.
    *   Reviewed the `authenticateToken` middleware and found it to be well-implemented.
    *   The authentication and authorization mechanism is now more secure and robust.
*   **Production Deployment:**
    *   Created a `Dockerfile` for the main backend service.
    *   Created a `Dockerfile.ingestion` for the ingestion engine.
    *   Created a `Dockerfile.websocket` for the WebSocket server.
    *   Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the different services.

## 2025-08-14

*   **New Pipeline Definition:**
    *   Defined a new, detailed article processing pipeline based on the user's specifications.
    *   The new pipeline includes:
        *   **Fact-Checking:** Google Fact Check API.
        *   **Summarization:** Grok (X.ai) API with OpenAI and Gemini as fallbacks.
        *   **AI Chat:** Best model for finance queries.
        *   **Detailed Processing Steps:** Fetching, fact-checking, categorization, summarization, translation, and final checks.
    *   Updated the `ArticleFetchLogic.md` file with the new pipeline definition.

## Project Status Summary

### Project Overview

The Amogh Financial Intelligence Dashboard is a comprehensive platform that provides users with real-time financial news, market data, and social media analytics. The project consists of a Next.js frontend and a Node.js backend.

### Architecture

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka

### Features

*   **News Ingestion:** Ingests news articles from various RSS feeds and GNews.
*   **Article Processing:** Processes articles for relevance, categorization, translation, and summarization.
*   **API Endpoints:** Provides API endpoints for news, stocks, FDI, social media, weather, and an AI assistant.
*   **Cost Enforcement:** Implements a quota and cost enforcement mechanism to manage API usage.
*   **Metrics and Monitoring:** Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring.

### Development Status

*   The backend is in a stable state with all tests passing.
*   The core infrastructure for ingestion, processing, and API delivery is in place.

### Pending Tasks

*   **Real GNews Integration:** The current GNews implementation is a stub. It needs to be replaced with a real GNews API integration.
*   **Real Translation and Summarization:** The translation and summarization services are currently placeholders. They need to be integrated with real services.
*   **Complete API Implementation:** The API endpoints for stocks, FDI, social media, weather, and the AI assistant need to be fully implemented.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement a secure authentication and authorization mechanism for the API.
*   **Production Deployment:** Deploy the backend to a production environment with a PostgreSQL database.
