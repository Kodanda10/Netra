# Amogh Backend Development Log

## 2025-08-11

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   Switched to new working directory: `/Users/abhijita/Documents/Project_Netra`.
    *   Imported `backend` folder, `ArticleFetchLogic.md`, and `test_results.log` from `/Users/abhijita/Documents/Project_Amogh`.
    *   Created `src/index.js` with a basic Express server, as the original entry point was missing.
    *   Updated `package.json` to point to the new `src/index.js` file.
    *   Installed npm dependencies.
*   **Started Development Server:**
    *   Ran `npm run dev` to start the backend server.
    *   **Cost Enforcer Implementation & Testing:**
    *   Created `src/cost/limits.js` and `src/cost/enforcer.js` based on `ArticleFetchLogic.md`.
    *   Created `src/__tests__/cost_enforcer.test.ts` with tests for burst quota, cooldown, and GNews cap.
    *   Configured `vitest` to find tests in `src/__tests__`.
    *   All tests are now passing.
